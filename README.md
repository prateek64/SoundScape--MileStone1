# SoundScape--MileStone1
This is my first milestone for my final project. (REQUIRES HEADPHONES)

I am exploring the creation of soundscapes ( rendering 3D audio ) using HRTF's on headphones. Currently I am using the following addons/libraries:

a. OpenAL SOft (https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft)
b. OpenAL (https://www.openal.org/)
c. ofxMIDI
d. HRTF's from IRCAM  (http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen/)

Currently my system includes an alien visitor who is exploring the world of spatial audio. The GUI has different sound fields where the alien 
can enter and exit. The main feature is an aura which when you enter lets you play Midi notes in the 3D space around your head  ( while wearing
your headphones). THe alien can go to different locations and experience the Midi drum kit, move the notes in the 3D space. The alien can also use
the mic input to randomly move the notes around his/her head. 

Coming Up 

1. Granular Synthesis on songs around the midi aura 
2. A new view which explores ambient sound sources around us ( rain, wind, thunder etc.) in different locations
in 3D 

3. Better Graphics
